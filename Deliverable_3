^^^Training and validation losses midway through optimization efforts

Our team experimented with various keras optimizers and learned a lot about adapting our parameters with the
type of model we wished to create. At first, we chose the Adam optimizer for its simplicity and low computation usage
for our tasks. Moreover, it was well suited for our stock prediction data that was quite large. However, we first used the
default learning rate of 0.001 and quickly noticed
